# Online Tour Guide System - Ceylon Tours

Developed as a university project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module in the second year, first semester, this online platform—Ceylon Tours—is designed to connect tourists with local guides, enhancing travel experiences across Sri Lanka. The system offers tailored functionalities for two distinct user types: tourists and guides. Tourists can explore, book, and review tours, while guides manage tour details and schedules through a dedicated dashboard.

Key Features:

Dual-User Registration and Login: Separate registration processes for tourists and tour guides, with custom dashboard redirection.
Comprehensive CRUD Operations: Efficient data handling using Java Servlets and DAO design for profiles, tours, and bookings.
User-Friendly Interface: Professionally designed account management and registration forms for a seamless user experience.
This project showcases skills in #JavaDevelopment, #WebApplication design, and #TravelTech innovations, making it a valuable resource in the #TourismPlatform domain. Built using #JavaServlets and implementing #CRUDOperations, the system enhances #TouristExperience through an intuitive interface.

Technologies Used: Java, Servlets, DAOs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
